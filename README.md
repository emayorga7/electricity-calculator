# âš¡ Electricity Calculator & EV Tracker

A personal React + Vite + Tailwind CSS app for:

1. **Electricity Bill Calculator (ESPH)**  
   - Calculates monthly bill from 9th â†’ 9th of each cycle.  
   - Tiered consumption and cost breakdown per component (FCV, E01, CVC, ENE, IVE, APU, TCB, CVP).  
   - Shows both **current estimated bill** and **projected bill** at the end of the cycle.  
   - Toggle between current vs projected breakdowns.  
   - Saves the initial meter reading for each cycle (local storage).  

2. **EV Recharge Tracker (work in progress)**  
   - CRUD tool to log home EV charging sessions.  
   - Fields: Date, meter readings, battery percentage, time spent, km traveled, amperes, etc.  
   - Goal: calculate how much of the electricity bill is due to EV charging.  
   - Future: graphs, reports, and integration with the calculator.
